builing app from scratch in container itself.
not like creating app first on your machine and then dockerizing it.


1. create Dockerfile
2. create docker-compose.yml
3. create requirements.txt file



Now start creating django project as:

1. docker-compose run web django-admin startproject docker_django1 .		[web is a service name]

2. docker-compose up								[this will start you container, and your django app as well]
tip: you can literally visit browser and type: "127.0.0.1:1234", to see django app up and running.


3. docker exec 4c00d4b47c0b python manage.py startapp app1
exec command of docker is used to execute commnads on existing container without creating a new one. 4c00d4b47c0b is the ID of container

4. docker exec 4c00d4b47c0b python manage.py makemigrations

5. docker exec 4c00d4b47c0b python manage.py migrate

6. python manage.py createsuperuser


if you want to visit into your container use following command and play with file system
docker container exec -it 4c00d4b47c0b /bin/bash
where 4c00d4b47c0b is an id of the container
