CD constant deployment
----------------------

1. download and install heroku cli
2. open terminal and check if heroku is installed: heroku --version

now git hub wants some authentications to interact with heroku, that is usually done with heroku login.
but in case of automation we have to provide something as a way of authentication that is when token comes in picture.
3. heroku authorizations:create	[this command will create a token which will used by yml to interact with heroku to deploy our app]
	                        [example, Token:       1ecf254b-d9ae-47aa-8266-5bf506d411a3]
now this token can be put in yml but this will be hardcoded and visible when repository is public, which is not a good thing so git hub provides somthing called 'secrets'
